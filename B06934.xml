            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>For when a Man he doth them ſend</l>

               <l>The Bearer falleth down by the way,</l>

            </lg>

               <l>Then what do you ſay to thoſe Glaſſes fine?</l>
               <l>Yes, they ſhall have no Praiſe of mine;</l>
               <l>For when a Company they are ſet</l>
               <l>For to be merry, as we are met;</l>

               <l>True, they ſhall have no Praiſe of me,</l>
               <l>For when a Man and his Wife falls at Strife,</l>
               <l>As many have done, I know, in their Life;</l>
               <l>They lay their Hands on the Pot both,</l>

               <l>For caſting their Liquor ſo vainly away:</l>
               <l>But had it been in the Leather Bottel,</l>
               <l>They might have tugg'd, till their Hearts did ake,</l>

               <l>True, they ſhall have no Praiſe of mine;</l>
               <l>For when a Lord he doth them ſend</l>
               <l>To be filled with Wine as he doth intend;</l>
               <l>The Man with the Flaggon he doth run away,</l>
               <l>Becauſe it is Silver moſt gallant and gay:</l>
               <l>O then the Lord he begins to ban,</l>
               <l>And ſwears he hath loſt both Flaggon and Man;</l>
               <l>There is never a Lord's Serving man, or Groom,</l>

               <l>A Leather Bottel we know is good,</l>
               <l>Far better than Glaſſes or Cans of Wood,</l>
               <l>For when a Man is at work in the Field,</l>
               <l>Your Glaſſes and Pots no Comfort will yield;</l>
               <l>Then a good Leather Bottle ſtanding him by,</l>
               <l>He may drink always when he is a dty;</l>
               <l>It will revive the Spirits and comfort the Brain,</l>
               <l>Wherefore let none this Bottle refrain:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For I wiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alſo the honeſt Sith-man too,</l>
               <l>He knew not very well what to do,</l>
               <l>But for his Bottle ſtanding him near,</l>
               <l>That is filled with good Houſhold-beer:</l>
               <l>At Dinner he ſits him down to eat,</l>
               <l>With good hard Cheeſe, and Bread or Meat;</l>
               <l>Then this Bottle he takes up amain,</l>
               <l>And drinks and ſets him down again;</l>
               <l>Saying, Good Bottle, ſtand my Friend,</l>
               <l>And hold out till this Day doth end:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For I wiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And likewiſe the Hay-makers they,</l>
               <l>When as they are turning and making their Hay,</l>
               <l>In Summer-weather, when as it is warm,</l>
               <l>A good Bottel full then will do them no harm;</l>
               <l>And at Noon-time they ſit them down,</l>
               <l>To drink in their Bottles of Ale nut-brown;</l>
               <l>Then the Lads and Laſſes begins to tattle,</l>
               <l>What ſhould we do but for this Bottle?</l>
               <l>They could not work if this Bottle were done,</l>
               <l>For the Day's ſo hot with heat of the Sun:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then I wiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>

               <l>About the Bottel's Ears doth fall;</l>
               <l>And if his Liquor be almoſt gone,</l>
               <l>His Bottel he will part with to none,</l>

               <l>One Drop I will not part withal:</l>
               <l>You muſt go drink at ſome Spring or Well,</l>
               <l>For I will keep my Leather Bottel:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then I wiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus you may hear of a Leather Bottel,</l>
               <l>When at it is filled with Liquor full well,</l>
               <l>Though the Subſtance of it be but ſmall,</l>
               <l>Yet the Name of the thing is all.</l>
               <l>There's never a Lord, Earl, or Knight,</l>
               <l>But in a Bottel doth take Delight;</l>
               <l>For when he is hunting of the Deer,</l>
               <l>He often doth wiſh for a Bottle of Beer:</l>
               <l>Likewiſe the Man that works at the Wood,</l>
               <l>A Bottel of Beer doth oft do him good:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then I wiſh,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then when this Bottel doth grow old,</l>
               <l>And will good Liquor no longer hold,</l>
               <l>Our of the Side you may take a Clout,</l>
               <l>Will mend your Shooes when they'r worn out;</l>
               <l>Elſe take it and bang it upon a Pin,</l>
               <l>It will ſerve to put many odd Trifles in,</l>
               <l>As Hinges, Awls, and Candle-ends,</l>
               <l>For young Beginners muſt have ſuch things:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then I wiſh in Heaven his Soul may dwell,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That firſt deviſed the Leather Bottel.</hi>
